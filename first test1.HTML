    <h1>What are the pc components?? </h1>

        <p>A pc is not a very complicated devise as a hardware if you understand whats it made from.There are 7 main pc components which are the Processor or cpu which is the brain of the pc, second we have the Graphics Processing Unit or gpu which is the main part that controls the graphics of your setup, third we have the Graphics Processing Unit which is the man component that we join the gpu and cpu and ram and all the main commponents in to make it work, forth we have the Memory where we stor all our files in it as a software so we dont lose them, fifth we have the Storage : As RAM is just a short-term memory and doesn’t store data without power, you should get a long-term storage device (HDD or SSD). As known to all, HDDs are cheaper and slower than SSDs. However, SSDs charge you a high price. You can pick one hard drive according to your demand and sixth we have the Power Supply Unit which is connected to the power or electrecity to power your pc and make it wok and finally seventh we have the Power Supply Unit which we store in alll the bcomponents as a hardware. i tried to make the paragraph as simple as it can get.</p>

      <h1>Processor:</h1>
      <p>Processor is also known as central processing unit (CPU), which is compared to the brain of a computer. It converts the instructions you send into actions that computer can execute and tells other parts on the computer to work corporately.</p>

    <h1>Graphics Processing Unit:</h1>
    <p>Graphics processing unit (GPU) is designed to calculate anything associated with visuals and output visuals including images, user, interface, and GUI. Here are two main GPUs (integrated GPU and discrete GPU).</p>

  <h1>Mother board:</h1>
  <p>Motherboard actually is a large circuit board in the computer that connects all the components needed to build a PC together. It allows different hardware communicates with each other. The specific motherboard type you should choose depends on the CPU you bought to a large extent.</p>

<h1>Memory:</h1>
<p>The RAM stores data being actively worked on by the CPU. It is a short-term memory on your computer. Though it can read and write quickly, you will lose everything when the power is turned off. If you don’t have enough RAM, your computer will not function well.</p>

<h1>Storage:</h1>
<p>As RAM is just a short-term memory and doesn’t store data without power, you should get a long-term storage device (HDD or SSD). As known to all, HDDs are cheaper and slower than SSDs. However, SSDs charge you a high price. You can pick one hard drive according to your demand.</p>

<h1>Power Supply Unit:</h1>
<p>Power Supply Unit (PSU) provides the power needed to run your machine. Though PSU is often overlooked by users, it is still an important component when building a custom computer. To buy a great PSU, you should take efficiency, wattage, and quality into account. These requirements can be fulfilled by a reputable manufacturer.</p>

<h1>Computer Case:</h1>
<p>Last but not least, you should get a good computer case. The computer case is where all the above item located. When selecting a computer case, make sure that it has abundant airflow to cool down computer parts and has sufficient space to fit everything.</p>
